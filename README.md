# Crunchyroll WebScraper
Program I built to scrape show data from crunchyroll using python + playwright + sqllite

This program scrapes show data from crunchyroll by checking a list of all series once a week
and checks a list of shows updated in the last week every hour. The goal of this project is to set up
a system to notify myself of changes to the crunchyroll database
